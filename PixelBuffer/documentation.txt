this where most of the work will done

we will use pixel buffer so we can communicate daynamicly betewen CUDA and OpenGL
our algorim volume ray casting will out put pixels this pixel are gonna be stored in 
cuda resorce wich is maped to an Opengl pixe buffer object this PBO will unpacked into
a texture object finally OpenGL will draw this texture to a quard and display it us fast as it could
