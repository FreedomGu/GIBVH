As we all know the first step in space carving algortihm is exctracting the silhouette information from images
in this case our entry is Data set of images and not live stream video from Camera.

we are going to do a simple image processing in the fly on cuda and extract the silhouette information send it back to cpu

after every imaged processed it will be merged in to one single array and it will be send to gpu and stay there


using pinned memory to alocate images in host is slower coz the amont of data per image is to small
and when i use pinned memory to store all data we can see the throwput is at max and the timing in
copy data is decreased for more information check the link(1)
